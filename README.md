# README
- My working assumption is you have Python3 through anaconda
- Example modified from: ```https://www.kaggle.com/code/jchen2186/machine-learning-with-iris-dataset/notebook```
- I tend to use Unix, and my understanding of Windows is very limited, and it may be easiest to use https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html. If you are interested in working through power shell I'd love to help if I can!

## Purpose of the example
- provide a ''quick and easy'' example of machine learning
- apply concepts used in lesson
- provide existing script that can be built on top of or modify

## How to access

1. Click code > downlaod zip
2. ```git clone git@github.com:lms464/ML_example.git```

## Download Scikit.learn
- Mac or Linux: 
	- ```conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn ```
	- ```conda install seaborn```
- Windows: open your annaconda prompt then ```conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn ``` or through the Anaconda desktop helper: https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html


## I don't use conda
- Same options for Mac, Linux or Windows as above:
	- ```pip install -U scikit-learn```
	- ```pip install seaborn```
- Note though, if you are using conda, **try** and avoid using pip. It is not always possible

## Running the Jupyter notebook
- ``` jupyter notebook jupyter notebook Iris-ML-Example.ipynb```
- or through the Anaconda desktop helper: https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html
